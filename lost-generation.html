        <p class="mpbstxt">Why is it lost and what impacts can it bring.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="about"><br><br><br>
        <p class="ntxt">Many people who are self-improving may or not noticed that today's generation (Gen-Z) became aggresive, toxic, unhappy, disloyal, or even criminal. But how did this happen? and what does this do to us and our world?
            <br><br>It has been proven by other teenagers that they feel in the wrong generation and i can say the same. although when i was at school i was in a class where majority of them were from the <b>"Hoffnungslose Generation"</b> (Ger: hopeless generation). i felt alone (litteraly) and not a part of them. So why do we concider today's generation as hopeless:<br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="sectxt">Why is today's generation hopeless:</p>

        <p class="ntxt">
            Keep in mind that everything i will say in this chapter is backed and proven by other teenagers and scientifically.<br><br>
            <b>- Woman prefer selling their body than working</b><br>
            I cannot blame them for choosing this route. Girls doing onlyfans makes more money than what a normal worker earns <b>within a year</b>. But there is a very big issue. They produce the Pornography which drains your wallet and mental state. And the marketing is how many clean people concider: "Annoying" because they advertice their OnlyFans in places where it's unwanted. Another issue is that they cannot have a real relationship because their body is exposed to potentially 8 Billion people around the world and most boys in a relationships do want the girl for themselfs.<br>
            <br><b>- Pornography</b><br>
            Pornography is something which destroys your mentally. it changes your perspective towards girls and it drains your time because it can develop to a addiction. although pornography is concidered from most teenagers as Sex-ED. well kinda correct. it shows how to do sex but it shows a relationship which is highly unrealistic. now imagine a day without the internet. you will struggle! and become depressed.
            <br><br><b>- Social Media Influence</b><br>
            There is 2 types of influence: <b class="green-text-shadow">Good</b> influence or <b class="red-text-shadow">Bad</b> influence. Every teenager nowdays have at least 1 phone and at least have 1 social media app. Every <b>8.</b> Person on the world is using tiktok and every <b>5.</b> is using Instagram. Many people are influenced by these 2 apps due their captivative short form content (and images) and they do it unconcious too which i can prove that i myself sometime unconciously opened Instagram or Discord.<br><br>Not just Social Media even the music they consume. Flexing with Money, Drugs, Alcohol, Hoes and Expensive Sports Cars. They may wanna try these drugs too who knows. At least it didnt touched me.<br><br><i>"The days without a phone is over"</i><br>- CopyWealth
        
            <br><br><b>- Less serious relationships</b><br>
            Something what i and other teenagers spectated is that today's generation has a issue with dating. Today's generation has made a unwritten rule that states: <i>"If you're ugly you get 0. If you're attractive you get more than 1"</i> It is not new that people have a dream type of their soulmate but today's generation has reinforced this and they show it extremely. And for GEN-Z that got a relationship they will be leaven or cheated on very quickly.<br><br>Some teenager once said <i>"While you have one girlfriend, she has 3 other boyfriends"</i> where i ask where is the loyality?<br>If a boy gets vulnable with a girl she leaves him, again where is the loyality and emotional support?<br>And if there is 1 thing which one of them do not like the relationship is broken commonly when the male is broke. again what is the purpose of relationships?<br><br>Can GEN-Z Date? Can GEN-Z have a relationship like our grandparents do? The anwser is complicated it depends on how you see it. But the anwser is "Yes, they can date" but less people are willing to do that. You may go outside and only see hopeless young people where you think: "WTF? is tis shit?". that is your perspective not the reality
            
            <br><br><b>- Body Count & Sex</b><br>
            It is not supprising that today's generation are the horniest since they have uncontrolled access to pornography. Some people are so horny that only want sex and no love in life. and many people want to fuck so many people as possible like a video game to grind that "Body Count" up to a world record.

        <br><br><p class="sectxt">How does this Impact us:</p>
        <p class="ntxt">There will be less people who like to raise childrens or even marriage because of today's people which brings the birthrate low and maybe to 0%</p>
