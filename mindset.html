    </div>

    <div id="about">
        <p class="sectxt">Why is it important:</p>
        <p class="ntxt">This world is chaotic and challanging for us, I know that very well by my own experience in this world. Let's look at the successful entrepreneurs: <b>Steve Jobs</b>, <b>Elon Musk</b>, <b>Andrew Tate</b> they have the mindset of motivation, discipline and most importantly a Singular Mind where they don't get hurt from outside source like us humans and relationships.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="ntxt">Let me explain you this. Every month there are 1 million <u>New</u> Businesses but <u>99%</u> of them fail because they don't have the entrepreneur mindset which gives them the knowledge and strength to run a business</p>
        <br><br><p class="sectxt">What is a Entrepreneur Mindset:</p>
        <p class="ntxt">A Entrepreneur Mindset is similar to "Sigma" Mindset. They have a great self confidence, they think business oriented and they don't let negativity controll them, because they have the controll to their own life they never followed the things they been told to and they never let relationships take controll of their life and goals. A mindset that guides them to success!<br><br></p>
        <p class="ntxt">I discovered that mindset back then when i was fighting with a heartbreak where i discovered the truths and reality of relationships and how many people are living unhappy working from 9 to 5 because they are living inside a reality that requires working that the goverment allows you to live. A Sigma mindset may make you a sexist it may ruin your relationships but it makes you a great business man and creates your entrepreneur mindset. I always tell to myself these following questions at every decision: <i>"Is it worth it?"</i>, <i>"Does it make any sense."</i>, <i>"Do i really need this?"</i> Instead of being the "Slave" in this matrix. Let's Just become the "Boss" of your own business!</p>
        <br><br><p class="sectxt">How to achive this?:</p>
        <p class="ntxt">1. Have discipline<br>
        2. Stay motivated at stuff you like doing<br>
        3. Keep on track.<br>
        4. Stay away from negativity<br>
        5. Don't let your life get controlled<br>
        6. Be self confident<br>
        7. Work Hard and Smarter<br>
        8. Do not let your feelings out.<br><br>and most importantly. Set yourself clear goals that you can achieve. Split your major goals into small goals.</p>
